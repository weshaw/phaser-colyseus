# Western Marches / 4x style City builder

Basically you run the town all the DnD adventures start in, sending adventuring bands out on quests and protecting the city. As time passes a story will develop around this settlement.

You are a brand new settlement on the edge of the wilderness. Keep your city alive while defending against the perils of the forest. 
Take care of your population and train adventuring bands that will help you expand and defend your new nation.
As the adventurers explore they will unlock resources, new buildings gain notoriety for your new nation and encourage more people to migrate to the new world.

Every game will tell  a different story.
